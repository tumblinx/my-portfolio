# MIGRATION TO ANGULAR PROJECT
This project was my first web development project and the code was very much thrown together. A much better project is in the progress of getting built, it will be built using Angular 17.

# My Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. 
This site is designed to showcase my projects, skills, and professional information as a software developer.
It's built using React for the frontend and is hosted on GitHub Pages, with a backend prepared for handling email functionalities which is not currently hosted.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Offers a brief introduction and a welcoming message.
- **Projects**: Showcases detailed information about the projects I have worked on. I hope to expand this page a bit more
- **About**: Currently not implemented, but will detail my professional journey.
- **Contact Form**: Designed to allow people to send emails directly through the website. The backend functionality for handling emails is prepared but not currently hosted online.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Routing**: React Router for seamless navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for email functionality. Ready for deployment but not currently hosted.
- **Email Service**: Prepared for integration with services like SendGrid or Mailgun for sending emails through the contact form.
